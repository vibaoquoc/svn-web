* Write a 'help' action with associated documentation.

* cleanup the template structure with hooks

* diff directory and branch support.

* distinguish different node under same path in different revisions.

* provide link with svn dav url.

* users might only be interested in the latest few active
  branches/tags - hlb
  - as well as log history. it shouldn't list all by default.

* some switches for svnweb-install to do upgrade and file merging.

* cache more branch info for performance.

* display branches only if that branch contains the current directory.

* use svn_fs_history_t to get fixed amount of log first.

* sort branch info in browse.

* supply last-modified in header and check it.

* Add an 'annotation' action

* Fix bugs reported through RT

* If there's only one repo then going to the root should (?) automatically
  take you to it.

* Possibly a difference in the localisation between "Revision" as a
  title, column heading, or whatever, and "Revision \d+" referring to
  a specific revision number.

* Templates and I18N should be more tightly coupled.
