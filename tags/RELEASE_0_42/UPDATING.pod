=item

The format for specifying actions in the configuration file has changed.
In addition, there are no longer any default actions -- any actions not
specified in the configuration file will be ignored.

To retain existing functionality you must ensure that the following
appears in F<config.yaml>.

  actions:
    browse:
      class: SVN::Web::Browse
    checkout:
      class: SVN::Web::Checkout
    diff:
      class: SVN::Web::Diff
    list:
      class: SVN::Web::List
    log:
      class: SVN::Web::Log
    revision:
      class: SVN::Web::Revision
    rss:
      class: SVN::Web::RSS
    view:
      class: SVN::Web::View

=item

There have been several changes to the F<trac> templates.  If you have made
any local modifications then you will need to merge your changes in to the
new templates.

=item

Use of the C<templatedir> configuration directive is now deprecated.  You
should use C<templatedirs> instead.  This is to support third party actions
that supply their own templates in different directories.

C<templatedir> in the configuration file will continue to work, but you
should change existing entries of the form:

  templatedir: '/path/to/directory'

to this form:

  templatedirs:
    - '/path/to/directory'

A configuration file that specifies both C<templatedir> and C<templatedirs>
will generate an exception when anyone browses the repository.

=back

=head2 0.40 to 0.41

After installing the new module you should copy
F<lib/Templates/trac/header> to F<< <dir>/template/trac/header >>, where
F<< <dir> >> is the directory in which you ran C<svnweb-install>.

=head2 Anything < 0.40 to 0.40

The 0.40 release includes sweeping changes to the templates, as well
as additional functionality and configuration directives.  See F<CHANGES>
for details.

The simplest approach is to backup your existing F<config.yaml> and then
re-run C<svnweb-install>.  This will generate a new F<config.yaml> and
copy over the new templates and other files.

It should be easy to migrate your old configuration directives to the new
configuration file.
